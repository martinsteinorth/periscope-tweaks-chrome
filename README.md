# Periscope Tweaks Plugin for Chrome

This chrome plugin enables you to filter your timetracker overview to only show jobs that match your position. This way, your timetracker view will be nice and lean. A sticky bar at the bottom of your viewport always shows the date for each column and sums up your recorded entries, telling you if you have already the minimun of 8 hours per day.

Built on https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension. See their README for build instructions.
